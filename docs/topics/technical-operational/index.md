# Technical and Operational

Welcome! If you are involved in technical or operational aspects of establishing a Federated EGA node, you are in the right place. The information here covers topics related - but not limited - to technical infrastructure, testing, software/hardware, SOPs, Helpdesk, and team capacity building.

**You might find this page useful if you are:**
- a technical team leader
- responsible for procuring resources 
- a software developer or engineer
- a bioinformatician
- a support officer

**By exploring these materials, you will be able to:**
- Understand guidelines and standards for establishing and operating a node
- Set up your node using the local EGA software stack
- Interact with Central EGA using RabbitMQ
- Evaluate your node implementation using the FEGA Maturity Model
- Plan your node end-to-end demonstrator

## 1. Identify node requirements

### Standards

- The <a href="https://ega-archive.org/files/EGA-Node-Operations-v2.pdf" target="_blank">FEGA Node Operations Guidelines</a> document gives an overview of the operational areas which require resources in order to establish and operate a Federated EGA node. The document is based on more than 10 years experience of establishing and operating the EMBL-EBI and CRG Central EGA nodes. It provides a breakdown of the operational areas of responsibility into Helpdesk Services, Technical Operations, Software Development, and IT Infrastructure.
- Federated EGA was established on the principle of implementing global, community standards, including those developed as part of <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org/" target="_blank">GA4GH</a> and <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/" target="_blank">ELIXIR</a>.
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9R8W3V3ugU" target="_blank">Overview of local EGA services and architecture</a> (19 June 2020)

### Software

A minimal Federated EGA node can be set up on your local infrastructure using the <a href="https://github.com/EGA-archive/LocalEGA" target="_blank">localEGA software (GitHub repository)</a> and the associated <a href="https://localega.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank">Readthedocs</a> webpages. It is not required to use the local EGA software suite, but it is a great option compared to developing your own Federated EGA node software from scratch.

More information about the local EGA software and its implementation can be found in this report on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4893191" target="_blank">implementation and documentation to create an operational EGA node</a> (2 June 2021).

### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

It is useful to establish SOPs for common node operational tasks to enable consistent service delivery and streamline internal processes. Use this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BWPL9I9PlWiea6k-vcDDwaMu3rM5FSdV_0n8u7hAQpg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">template to develop SOPs for your own node</a>.

Standard interactions between Central EGA and Federated EGA node Helpdesk staff have been developed into a set of SOPs. Follow these SOPs below.

#### Shared FEGA &harr; CEGA SOPs

The following SOPs must be followed as part of current FEGA &harr; CEGA node interactions during the submission process:

- <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c5YfLqGjCmRlG0NF9lsuU6IWUrCq4u8Ug3Ye5xMrxtI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Federated EGA Request from submitter to submit to FEGA node</a>

Central EGA Helpdesk have developed a set of SOPs to harmonise both user-facing processes and internal processes. Explore some examples of these SOPs below or organised in this <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14yFvXOxRyGl-ENogIB5TdogIUdL-gmfk?usp=sharing" target="_blank">shared EGA Helpdesk SOP Google Drive</a>. Please note these are example SOPs and will need to be adapted to how your node operates!

## 3. Evaluate your implementation

- Understand the domains in which a node matures using the [Federated EGA Maturity Model](../maturity-model/)
- Assess the technical and operational maturation of your node by doing a self-assessment against the Federated EGA Maturity Model (Coming soon!)
- Demonstrate the full set of node services for users by planning your <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m7WDC112e73Kw79baZcsRsQOkAAGKtp_AiqJRhrgtUk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Federated EGA end-to-end demonstrator</a>
- Determine compliance of services with FEGA specifications by performing compliance tests (Coming soon!)
- Evaluate ability to scale services by performing stress tests (Coming soon!)
